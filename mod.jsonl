{"prompt":"I bought these for my daughter because she grew out of her older prior panties. Since these were a new design I figured we get these to see if they were truly improved. Unfortunately, they just are not very durable at all. The first pair shredded in the wash after just the first use. I thought it was a fluke but made sure the next time to put them in a garment bag like I do our bras. The second pairs lining shredded apart as well. Now she only has one pair left but I have no confidence these will last past another wash. The old design may not have absorbed as much but they worked and didn't fall apart with washing. I will be purchasing the old style again the next time. I recommend you save your money and not buy these. They may as well be disposable since they don't hold up to washing. ->","completion":" compliant \n"}

I'm not proportioned in any kind of remarkable way, so this was a little surprising. 4 stars for a less than completely comfortable wear, but very effective functionally. ->","completion":" compliant \n"}
{"prompt":"I bought these for when I was post partum in case I leaked through my pads, I wanted something to be able to easily absorb the extra mess. That never ended up happening so I don`t know how well they hold up to that challenge but they are very comfortable high quality underwear. They arrive very spandexy like athletic shorts feeling, but when they go through the wash they feel more like really soft cotton. That may or may not appeal to some but it does not bother me too much. They fit fine, I`m usually a small but I ordered both the small and the medium and they both fit. ->","completion":" na \n"}

{"prompt":"This is a great cold brew kit. I love that it came with the canning jar for brewing. It`s significantly less clumsy and messy than my previous cold brew set-up (which involved brewing a whole bag of beans at once in a 6 qt food service bucket) and I love that it`s (theoretically) good forever - I considered a cloth filter type cold brew system, but didn`t like that the cloth filter needed to be replaced annually. This is much more sustainable. I filtered my finished cold brew through a paper filter, but I honestly don`t think that`s necessary - hardly anything was caught by the filter.What I didn`t like about this system is that it`s very difficulty to compost your coffee grounds after brewing. The grounds become very tightly compacted in the filter and I had to scrape them out with a butter knife (all the while fearing that I`d accidentally puncture the metal filter). Even with a butter knife, they were extremely difficult to get out of the filter and I eventually gave up and rinsed the filter out into the sink disposal.I`m really bummed that it was so much work to compost about 2\/3 of the grounds using this system, but it worked well and I don`t regret the purchase. ->","completion":" compliant \n"}

One day it dawned on me I needed to be able to attach the saw to my pole, for easier access to poles. Looked around for a couple hours and finally found this. The saw blade is very flexible which some people might not like. However I have noticed it makes it easier to cut small branches, as it bends away from the main branch. It`s very sturdy though. I believe in most cases you would have to worry about your pole breaking before this saw. Only used it a couple times, but it`s in my truck box all day with lots of rusty tools on Florida beaches and hasn`t rusted yet, even without oil. ->","completion":" na \n"}
